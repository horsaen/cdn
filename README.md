# The Bun Shop

Built with Bun, ElysiaJS, and NextJS.

## Development

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/horsaen/thebunshop
```

Then install dependencies:
```
cd thebunshop && pnpm i && cd api && bun i
```

Then start both projects:

Frontend:
```
pnpm dev -p 3001
```
^^ start this using any port other than 3000, as the API runs on this port ^^

Backend:
```
bun dev
```

## Production

The same steps follow, but uncomment rate limiter, adjust cors, and build the nextjs project. You're all set :3

## Screenshots

Will finish later

## Service files

I wrote service files :D
